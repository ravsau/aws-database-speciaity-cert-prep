## How does DMS perform conducted
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Task.CDC.html



To read ongoing changes from the source database, AWS DMS uses engine-specific API actions to read changes from the source engine's transaction logs. Following are some examples of how AWS DMS does that:

- For Oracle, AWS DMS uses either the Oracle LogMiner API or binary reader API (bfile API) to read ongoing changes. AWS DMS reads ongoing changes from the online or archive redo logs based on the system change number (SCN).

- For Microsoft SQL Server, AWS DMS uses MS-Replication or MS-CDC to write information to the SQL Server transaction log. It then uses the fn_dblog() or fn_dump_dblog() function in SQL Server to read the changes in the transaction log based on the log sequence number (LSN).

- For MySQL, AWS DMS reads changes from the row-based binary logs (binlogs) and migrates those changes to the target.

- For PostgreSQL, AWS DMS sets up logical replication slots and uses the test_decoding plugin to read changes from the source and migrate them to the target.

For Amazon RDS as a source, we recommend ensuring that backups are enabled to set up CDC. We also recommend ensuring that the source database is configured to retain change logs for a sufficient timeâ€”24 hours is usually enough.
